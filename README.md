## ‚ú® Core Features

This project demonstrates a next-generation productivity tool powered by AI:

* **Autonomous AI Agent Framework:** Developed a core framework for intelligent agents that leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) to interpret user intent, autonomously manage tasks, and execute complex, multi-step workflows.
* **Intelligent Communication Automation:** Integrated third-party APIs (e.g., Gmail, Slack) to empower AI agents to draft and dispatch context-aware email and message replies, significantly reducing manual communication overhead.
* **AI-Powered Productivity Insights:** Implemented an analytics module where AI agents analyze user activity and task patterns to generate daily work summaries and actionable insights, helping users optimize their workflow and focus.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
